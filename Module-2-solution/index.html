            It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language.
             Hypertext defines the link between web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. 
           The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.</P></div>
        <div class="b2 col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12"><div class="i2">CSS</div><P>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS,
            is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. 
            CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly,
             CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page. 
             It describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colors, fonts, spacing, and much more. 
             In short, you can make your website look however you want. CSS lets developers and designers define how it behaves, 
           including how elements are positioned in the browser.</P></div>
        <div class="b3 col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12"><div class="i3">JAVASCRIPT</div><P>JavaScript (JS) is the most popular lightweight, 
            interpreted compiled programming language. It can be used for both Client-side as well as Server-side developments.
             JavaScript also known as a scripting language for web pages.
            JavaScript is used by many developers (65% of the total development community), 
            and the number is increasing day by day. JavaScript is one such programming language that has more than 1444231 libraries and increasing rapidly.
             It is preferred over any other programming language by most developers.</P></div>
